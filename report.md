## 1\. Introduction

Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with an estimated 13.7 million new stroke cases each year globally \[1\]. In the United States alone, someone experiences a stroke approximately every 40 seconds, resulting in nearly 795,000 people suffering a stroke annually \[2\]. The economic burden is equally significant, with the direct and indirect costs of stroke care estimated to exceed $34 billion per year in the United States \[3\].

Despite these alarming statistics, research suggests that up to 80% of strokes are preventable through the management of modifiable risk factors and early intervention \[4\]. The challenge, however, lies in accurately identifying individuals at high risk and implementing effective preventative measures. Traditional risk assessment tools often lack the necessary precision and personalization to drive meaningful behavioral changes and medical interventions.

## 2\. Literature Review

### 2.1 Stroke Risk Factors and Prediction Models

Stroke risk assessment has evolved significantly over the past decades, from basic demographic and clinical factor analysis to sophisticated computational models. Grundy et al. \[5\] established that age, sex, blood pressure, smoking status, diabetes, and cholesterol levels remain the cornerstone variables in stroke risk prediction. Building upon these fundamentals, the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) emerged as one of the most widely used tools, integrating these variables into a cohesive scoring system \[6\].

However, traditional statistical models like FSRP have shown limitations in capturing complex, non-linear relationships between risk factors. As Heo et al. \[7\] demonstrated, machine learning approaches significantly outperform conventional methods, with reported increases in prediction accuracy of up to 15%. Their study utilizing deep neural networks achieved an AUC of 0.888 compared to 0.839 for traditional scoring systems.

Recent advancements have focused on incorporating more diverse data types. Wang et al. \[8\] developed a real-world retrospective machine learning model for predicting stroke recurrence in acute ischemic stroke patients. Their Random Forest model achieved impressive performance with an AUC of 0.946, identifying homocysteine levels, C-reactive protein, stroke severity, and hemispheric laterality as key predictive features.

Similarly, Abedi et al. \[9\] explored long-term stroke recurrence prediction using various machine learning algorithms, finding that laboratory values (HDL, hemoglobin A1c, creatinine) alongside demographic factors (age, BMI) were highly associated with recurrence. Their comprehensive approach generated 288 different models for predicting recurrence windows of 1-5 years, with the highest AUC of 0.79 for 1-year prediction.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Healthcare Applications

The application of machine learning in healthcare has gained significant traction, particularly in the domain of predictive diagnostics. Alruily et al. \[10\] conducted a comparative analysis of various models for cerebral stroke prediction, finding that ensemble methods combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (96.34%) and AUC (99.38%).

A systematic review by Asadi et al. \[11\] analyzed 20 studies on stroke prediction using machine learning, revealing Random Forest as the most efficient algorithm (highest accuracy in 25% of studies), with Support Vector Machine (SVM), stacking, and XGBoost also demonstrating strong performance. Their review highlighted laboratory data as critical for accurate prediction, particularly markers like homocysteine, C-reactive protein, and lipid profiles.

Explainability has emerged as a crucial consideration in healthcare AI applications. Moulaei et al. \[12\] employed Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to provide interpretability of their models, finding that Random Forest outperformed all models in predicting stroke with 99.9% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 99% accuracy. Their work emphasized the importance of model transparency for clinical adoption.

### 2.3 Web Technologies for Healthcare Applications

The implementation of healthcare applications requires careful consideration of technology stack choices. Next.js has emerged as a particularly suitable framework for healthcare applications due to its server-side rendering capabilities, which enhance performance and search engine optimization \[13\].

Saad et al. \[14\] demonstrated that React-based healthcare dashboards improved user engagement by 37% compared to traditional designs, attributing this to improved responsiveness and interactive data visualization capabilities. Their study also showed that healthcare professionals spent 28% less time interpreting patient data when using well-designed interactive dashboards.

Security considerations for healthcare web applications were thoroughly explored by Zhang et al. \[15\], who proposed a comprehensive framework for HIPAA-compliant web application development. Their approach emphasized the importance of encrypted data storage, secure authentication mechanisms, and careful API design to prevent data breaches.

### 2.4 Gaps in Existing Research and Practice

Despite significant advancements, several gaps remain in the current landscape of stroke prediction and management tools:

1. **Limited integration of real-time monitoring**: Most existing systems rely on periodic assessments rather than continuous monitoring of risk factors.

2. **Insufficient personalization**: Many tools provide generalized recommendations without adequate tailoring to individual user characteristics and preferences.

3. **Poor user engagement**: Technical complexity and clinical jargon often hinder user adoption and sustained engagement with health monitoring applications.

4. **Lack of comprehensive data utilization**: Many systems focus on a limited subset of risk factors, potentially missing important predictive signals from other health domains.

5. **Inadequate model interpretability**: Complex machine learning models often function as "black boxes," making it difficult for users and healthcare providers to understand the rationale behind predictions.

BrainWise addresses these gaps through its holistic approach to brain health monitoring, user-centric design philosophy, and emphasis on explainable AI. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques with accessible user interfaces, the system aims to overcome the limitations of existing tools and provide a more effective platform for stroke risk management.

  ```tsx
  // Example of the encryption utility implementation
  export async function encryptSensitiveData(data: string): Promise<string> {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(
      'aes-256-gcm', 
      await deriveEncryptionKey(), 
      iv
    );
    
    const encryptedData = Buffer.concat([
      cipher.update(data, 'utf8'),
      cipher.final()
    ]);
    
    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
    
    // Format: iv:authTag:encryptedData (base64 encoded)
    return Buffer.concat([iv, authTag, encryptedData]).toString('base64');
  }
  ```

#### 4.8.2 Authentication and Authorization

- **Clerk Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all healthcare providers
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for different user roles
  ```tsx
  // Access control middleware implementation
  export function withAuthorization(
    handler: NextApiHandler,
    requiredPermissions: Permission[]
  ): NextApiHandler {
    return async (req, res) => {
      // Use Clerk authentication
      const { userId } = auth();
      
      if (!userId) {
        return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
      }
      
      // Fetch user permissions from database
      const user = await db.user.findUnique({
        where: { id: userId },
        select: { permissions: true }
      });
      
      const hasRequiredPermissions = requiredPermissions.every(
        (permission) => user.permissions.includes(permission)
      );
      
      if (!hasRequiredPermissions) {
        return new Response("Insufficient permissions", { status: 403 });
      }
      
      // Log access attempt for audit trail
      await logAccessAttempt({
        userId,
        resource: req.url,
        action: req.method,
        granted: true
      });
      
      // Continue with the handler
      return handler(req, res);
    };
  }
  ```

#### 4.8.3 Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive activity logs**: All user actions and system events are recorded
- **Tamper-proof audit trail**: Immutable logs stored with cryptographic integrity verification

  // Example log structure
  interface AuditLogEntry {
    timestamp: Date;
    userId: string;
    userRole: UserRole;
    action: 'view' | 'create' | 'update' | 'delete' | 'export';
    resource: string;
    resourceId?: string;
    ipAddress: string;
    userAgent: string;
    changes?: Record<string, { before: unknown; after: unknown }>;
    statusCode: number;
    errorMessage?: string;
    hashChain: string; // Previous entry hash + current entry data
  }
  ```

#### 4.8.4 Data Minimization and Access Controls

- **Minimum necessary principle**: Users only have access to data required for their role
- **Automatic data redaction**: PHI is automatically masked in logs and non-clinical contexts
- **Temporary access escalation**: Just-in-time permissions with automatic expiration
  ```tsx
  // Data masking implementation
  export function maskSensitiveData(data: any, userPermissions: Permission[]): any {
    if (typeof data !== 'object' || data === null) return data;
    
    const result = Array.isArray(data) ? [...data] : { ...data };
    
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(result)) {
      if (sensitiveFields.includes(key) && !userPermissions.includes('view_phi')) {
        result[key] = typeof value === 'string' 
          ? value.replace(/./g, '*') 
          : '[REDACTED]';
      } else if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
        result[key] = maskSensitiveData(value, userPermissions);
      }
    }

  );
}
```

#### 3. Focus Management

The application implements a custom focus management system for modal dialogs and complex interactions:

```tsx
function useFocusTrap(ref: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const element = ref.current;
    if (!element) return;
    
    // Store the element that had focus before the modal opened
    const previouslyFocused = document.activeElement as HTMLElement;
    
    // Focus the first focusable element
    const focusableElements = element.querySelectorAll(
      'button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
    );
    
    if (focusableElements.length) {
      (focusableElements[0] as HTMLElement).focus();
    }
    
    // Create focus trap
    const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (e.key !== 'Tab') return;
      
      const firstFocusable = focusableElements[0] as HTMLElement;
      const lastFocusable = focusableElements[focusableElements.length - 1] as HTMLElement;
      
      // Shift + Tab
      if (e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === firstFocusable) {
        e.preventDefault();
        lastFocusable.focus();
      } 
      // Tab
      else if (!e.shiftKey && document.activeElement === lastFocusable) {
        e.preventDefault();
        firstFocusable.focus();
      }
    };
    
    element.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
    
    return () => {
      element.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
      // Restore focus when component unmounts
      previouslyFocused?.focus();
    };
  }, [ref]);
}
```

#### 4. Contrast and Color Considerations

The application uses a color system that ensures sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements:

```tsx
// Color contrast utility
const colorContrastMap = {
  primary: {
    onLight: 'text-primary-900',
    onDark: 'text-primary-100',
  },
  accent: {
    onLight: 'text-accent-900',
    onDark: 'text-accent-100',
  },
  // Other color variants
};

function ContrastAwareText({ color, isDarkMode, children }) {
  const contrastClass = isDarkMode 
    ? colorContrastMap[color].onDark 
    : colorContrastMap[color].onLight;
    
  return <span className={contrastClass}>{children}</span>;
}
```
