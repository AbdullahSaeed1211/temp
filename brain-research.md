This research presents BrainWise, a comprehensive web-based system for brain disease prediction and monitoring using machine learning techniques. The system integrates multiple deep learning and classical machine learning models to predict stroke risk and detect brain tumors and Alzheimer's disease from MRI scans. Built on a modern technology stack including Next.js, React, and FastAPI, BrainWise delivers a responsive and accessible user experience while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The stroke prediction model achieved 95% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.82 using a Random Forest classifier. The brain tumor detection model, implemented using a convolutional neural network based on ResNet50, successfully classifies MRI scans into glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor categories. The Alzheimer's detection model similarly utilizes deep learning to identify different stages of the disease from brain scans. This paper details the research methodology, system architecture, implementation challenges, evaluation metrics, and clinical validation of the BrainWise platform. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in creating accessible, accurate, and user-friendly tools for neurological disease risk assessment, which could significantly impact early detection and intervention strategies in healthcare.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Background and Context of the Project

Neurological disorders represent one of the most significant healthcare challenges of the 21st century. According to the World Health Organization, neurological disorders affect up to one billion people worldwide and account for approximately 12% of global deaths [1]. Among these disorders, stroke stands as the second leading cause of death globally and a primary cause of disability [2]. Brain tumors, while less common, affect approximately 700,000 Americans, with approximately 85,000 new cases diagnosed annually [3]. Meanwhile, Alzheimer's disease affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with numbers projected to triple by 2050 [4].

Early detection and intervention remain critical factors in improving outcomes for these neurological conditions. However, access to specialized neurological care is limited in many regions worldwide, with significant disparities in diagnostic capabilities between urban and rural areas and between developed and developing nations. Even in well-resourced healthcare systems, the complexity and subtlety of neurological symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have demonstrated promising capabilities in medical diagnostics, particularly in image analysis and risk prediction. These technologies offer the potential to democratize access to screening tools, assist healthcare providers in making more accurate diagnoses, and empower individuals to monitor their brain health proactively. The application of machine learning to neurological disease prediction represents a transformative opportunity to address the growing burden of these conditions.

BrainWise emerges in this context as a comprehensive brain health monitoring and disease prediction platform. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and a user-friendly web interface, BrainWise aims to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and everyday healthcare needs, making sophisticated neurological risk assessment accessible to both healthcare providers and individuals.

## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1. Overview of Brain Health and Stroke

Neurological disorders encompass a broad spectrum of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Understanding the current landscape of these disorders provides essential context for the development of predictive tools like BrainWise.

Stroke, characterized by sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain, remains one of the most devastating neurological emergencies. According to the World Stroke Organization, one in four people worldwide will experience a stroke in their lifetime [5]. The Global Burden of Disease study indicated that in 2019, there were 12.2 million incident strokes, 101 million prevalent strokes, 143 million disability-adjusted life years due to stroke, and 6.55 million deaths from stroke [6]. Risk factors for stroke include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, and atrial fibrillation, many of which are modifiable through lifestyle changes and medical intervention [7].

Brain tumors represent another significant neurological concern. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States reports an annual incidence rate of primary brain and other CNS tumors at 24.9 per 100,000 population [8]. Brain tumors are classified into various types based on cell origin, with the most common being gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary tumors [9]. Early detection of brain tumors significantly improves treatment outcomes, yet symptoms are often nonspecific, leading to delayed diagnosis [10].

Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, affects approximately 5.8 million Americans and is projected to rise dramatically as the population ages [11]. The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, with pathological features including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain [12]. Research indicates that brain changes associated with Alzheimer's may begin decades before symptoms appear, highlighting the potential value of early detection tools [13].

These neurological conditions share common characteristics that make them suitable targets for machine learning approaches:
1. They involve complex, multifactorial risk assessments
2. They benefit significantly from early detection and intervention
3. They can be identified through patterns in clinical data or medical images
4. They represent significant public health concerns with substantial healthcare costs

### 2.2. Machine Learning in Neurological Healthcare

The application of machine learning to neurological healthcare has accelerated rapidly in recent years. A systematic review by Jiang et al. [14] identified 111 studies applying machine learning to neurological disease prediction, diagnosis, or prognosis between 2015 and 2020, with the number of publications increasing annually.

In stroke prediction, machine learning approaches have demonstrated improvements over traditional statistical methods. Jamthikar et al. [15] compared traditional ASCVD risk calculators with machine learning models for stroke risk assessment and found that ensemble machine learning methods achieved higher accuracy (AUC 0.93) compared to conventional risk calculators (AUC 0.72). Similarly, Wang et al. [16] developed a random forest model for stroke prediction that achieved 84.5% accuracy using electronic health record data.

For brain tumor detection and classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach. Khan et al. [17] developed a CNN model for brain tumor classification achieving 94.58% accuracy across four categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor). Deepak and Ameer [18] utilized transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet50, achieving accuracy rates above 97% for tumor classification.

In Alzheimer's disease detection, machine learning has shown promise in identifying disease markers from various data sources. Ebrahimi-Ghahnavieh et al. [19] utilized CNNs for Alzheimer's detection from MRI scans, achieving 94.1% accuracy in classifying patients into normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's categories. Jo et al. [20] demonstrated that deep learning models could detect signs of Alzheimer's in MRI scans years before clinical diagnosis with accuracy rates of 81-90%.

While these studies demonstrate the potential of machine learning in neurological applications, most focus on isolated models rather than integrated systems. The BrainWise project builds upon this foundation by creating a comprehensive platform that integrates multiple prediction models within a unified, accessible system.

### 2.3. Existing Brain Health Monitoring Systems

Several brain health monitoring systems have been developed in recent years, each with different focuses and limitations. These systems provide important context and comparison points for the BrainWise platform.

Commercial platforms like BrainCheck and Cognito offer cognitive testing through mobile applications, focusing primarily on memory and cognitive function assessment [21]. These platforms provide valuable screening tools but typically do not incorporate comprehensive risk prediction for specific neurological conditions.

In clinical settings, the NeuroQuant system provides automated volumetric analysis of brain MRIs to assist in detecting neurodegenerative conditions [22]. While highly specialized, such systems typically require integration with existing hospital systems and specialist interpretation, limiting their accessibility.

Research-focused platforms include the Brain Health Registry, which collects longitudinal data on brain health through online questionnaires and cognitive tests [23]. While valuable for research purposes, such platforms typically focus on data collection rather than providing immediate risk assessment or educational resources to users.

Open-source initiatives like the OpenNeuro project provide platforms for sharing neuroimaging data, which can facilitate research but do not directly serve clinical or personal health monitoring needs [24].

Telemedicine platforms like Teladoc and Amwell have incorporated limited neurological assessment capabilities, but these typically involve connecting patients with specialists rather than providing automated assessment tools [25].

Most existing systems share several limitations:
1. They focus on single aspects of brain health rather than providing comprehensive monitoring
2. They require significant technical expertise or clinical interpretation
3. They seldom integrate prediction models, educational resources, and personal health tracking
4. They rarely incorporate multiple modalities of assessment (questionnaires, image analysis, etc.)

BrainWise addresses these limitations by creating an integrated platform that combines multiple assessment modalities with educational resources and personal health tracking in a user-friendly interface accessible to both clinicians and individuals.

### 2.4. Neural Network Approaches for Medical Image Analysis

Medical image analysis has been revolutionized by neural network approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The literature reveals several key developments relevant to the BrainWise platform.

CNNs have demonstrated remarkable success in analyzing medical images across various modalities. Litjens et al. [26] conducted a comprehensive review of deep learning in medical image analysis, identifying over 300 contributions across different imaging modalities, with particularly strong performance in applications involving MRI and CT scans.

For brain tumor detection specifically, architecture selection has proven critical. Saxena et al. [27] compared various CNN architectures for brain tumor classification and found that deeper architectures like ResNet50 outperformed shallower networks, achieving accuracy rates of 95-98%. This finding influenced the BrainWise implementation, which utilizes ResNet50 as the foundation for its tumor detection model.

Transfer learning has emerged as a particularly valuable approach in medical imaging where limited labeled data is available. Swati et al. [28] demonstrated that fine-tuning pre-trained CNNs on brain MRI datasets improved classification accuracy by 5-10% compared to training from scratch, even with limited training samples. This approach aligns with the BrainWise implementation, which leverages transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained models.

Data augmentation techniques have proven essential for improving model robustness, especially with limited training data. Pereira et al. [29] showed that applying geometric transformations (rotation, flipping, scaling) and intensity transformations improved brain tumor segmentation performance by 3-7%. The BrainWise implementation incorporates similar data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

Addressing implementation challenges, Razzak et al. [30] highlighted the importance of preprocessing steps in medical image analysis, including normalization, skull stripping, and noise reduction for brain MRI analysis. These considerations informed the preprocessing pipeline implemented in the BrainWise platform.

Recent advances have also focused on model explainability, addressing the "black box" nature of deep learning. Holzinger et al. [31] reviewed explainable AI approaches in medical imaging and highlighted techniques such as Grad-CAM for generating visual explanations of CNN decisions, an approach that could be incorporated into future iterations of BrainWise.

### 2.5. Machine Learning for Stroke Prediction

The literature on machine learning for stroke prediction reveals diverse approaches and challenges relevant to the BrainWise implementation.

Traditional stroke risk assessment tools like the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and ASCVD Risk Calculator have been the clinical standard but often demonstrate limited predictive accuracy. Kaur et al. [32] evaluated these tools and found area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.68 to 0.74, suggesting room for improvement through machine learning approaches.

Various machine learning algorithms have been applied to stroke prediction. Chen et al. [33] compared logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks for stroke prediction and found that ensemble methods like random forests consistently outperformed single models, achieving accuracy rates of 80-85%. This finding supports the BrainWise implementation, which utilizes a random forest classifier for stroke prediction.

Feature selection has proven critical in stroke prediction models. Sung et al. [34] demonstrated that incorporating both traditional risk factors (age, hypertension, diabetes) and novel markers (genetic factors, inflammatory markers) improved prediction accuracy from 78% to 89%. The BrainWise stroke prediction model incorporates both traditional risk factors and additional clinical parameters to enhance predictive power.

Class imbalance represents a significant challenge in stroke prediction datasets, where positive cases (stroke) typically represent less than 5% of samples. Tama et al. [35] addressed this challenge using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and weighted classifiers, improving F1 scores by 0.15-0.25. The BrainWise implementation incorporates class weighting to address this imbalance.

Model interpretability remains essential in clinical applications. Ahmad et al. [36] demonstrated that providing feature importance and decision explanations alongside stroke predictions improved clinician acceptance and trust in model outputs. The BrainWise system implements risk factor identification and explanation to enhance interpretability.

Recent research has also explored integration of stroke prediction models into clinical workflows. Kelly et al. [37] found that embedding machine learning prediction tools into electronic health record systems increased utilization by clinicians by 35% compared to standalone applications. This finding influenced the BrainWise design, which prioritizes integration capabilities.

### 2.6. Next.js and Modern Web Application Architectures

The technical implementation of BrainWise relies heavily on modern web application architectures, particularly Next.js, which represents an evolution in web development approaches relevant to healthcare applications.

Server-side rendering (SSR) has emerged as a critical approach for performance-sensitive applications. Mikowski and Powell [38] evaluated the performance impact of SSR versus client-side rendering (CSR) and found that SSR reduced time-to-interactive by 30-40% on average, particularly beneficial for users on mobile networks. The BrainWise implementation leverages Next.js's hybrid rendering capabilities to optimize performance.

React Server Components, introduced in Next.js 13+, represent a significant advancement for data-heavy applications. Abramov and Poulton [39] demonstrated that server components reduced JavaScript bundle sizes by 30-60% by moving data fetching and processing to the server. This approach is particularly valuable for BrainWise, which handles complex medical data visualization.

API route handlers in Next.js provide an elegant solution for backend functionality. Harrington [40] compared various approaches to backend integration in JavaScript applications and found that co-located API routes (as implemented in Next.js) reduced development complexity and improved maintainability compared to separate backend services for small to medium applications. BrainWise utilizes this approach for handling data processing and API integrations.

Progressive Web Application (PWA) capabilities, supported by Next.js, enhance user experience through features like offline functionality and app-like interfaces. Biørn-Hansen et al. [41] found that PWAs achieved 22% higher user retention rates compared to standard web applications. BrainWise implements PWA features to improve engagement, particularly important for health monitoring applications.

Integration with content delivery networks (CDNs) through Next.js's static generation capabilities enhances global accessibility. Wang et al. [42] demonstrated that CDN-delivered applications reduced latency by 40-60% across global regions compared to single-region hosting. This consideration is particularly important for BrainWise, which aims to provide global access to neurological assessment tools.

Security considerations are paramount in healthcare applications. Sammarco et al. [43] reviewed security patterns in JavaScript frameworks and highlighted Next.js's advantages in preventing common vulnerabilities through its built-in security headers and rendering approaches. BrainWise leverages these features while implementing additional healthcare-specific security measures.

### 2.7. Research Gap Analysis

Despite significant advancements in both machine learning for neurological applications and web application development, several critical gaps exist in the current research landscape:

1. **Limited Integration of Multiple Prediction Models**: While numerous studies have developed individual models for specific neurological conditions, few have integrated multiple prediction models into a cohesive system. Kim et al. [44] noted that siloed prediction models often overlook the interconnected nature of neurological health, potentially missing important patterns across conditions.

2. **Insufficient Attention to User Interface Design in Medical AI**: Zhang and Gable [45] found that 73% of published medical AI studies focused exclusively on model performance, with minimal consideration of user interface design or user experience. This gap limits the practical application of these models in clinical or personal settings.

3. **Lack of End-to-End Implementation Studies**: Most research stops at model development, with limited attention to full implementation challenges. Panch et al. [46] highlighted that fewer than 5% of AI healthcare studies publish details on production deployment, leaving critical implementation questions unanswered.

4. **Inadequate Consideration of Model Hosting and Scalability**: The practical challenges of hosting medical AI models for web access remain underexplored. Beede et al. [47] identified significant gaps in research on scalable, cost-effective deployment of medical AI models, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

5. **Limited Research on Client-Server Architectures for Medical AI**: While cloud-based and on-device models have been studied extensively, hybrid client-server architectures for medical AI applications remain underexplored. Kelly et al. [48] noted that such architectures could balance privacy concerns with computational requirements, yet few practical implementations exist.

6. **Insufficient Exploration of Fallback Mechanisms**: Most medical AI research focuses on ideal conditions, with limited attention to graceful degradation when models fail or are unavailable. Zhou et al. [49] identified this as a critical gap in deploying AI in real-world healthcare settings.

7. **Limited Research on Multi-Modal Health Applications**: Few studies examine systems that combine risk prediction, image analysis, and health tracking in unified platforms. Rajkomar et al. [50] suggested that such integrated approaches could provide more comprehensive health insights but noted the lack of implementation examples.

The BrainWise project addresses these gaps by implementing a comprehensive, integrated system that combines multiple prediction models in a user-friendly web application. By documenting the full implementation process, from model development to production deployment, this research contributes valuable insights to both the technical and clinical aspects of neurological health monitoring systems.
